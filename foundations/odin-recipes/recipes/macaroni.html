            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare macaroni noodles according to package instructions. 
                    Drain and rinse immediately with cold water, then drizzle with a 
                    teaspoon of olive oil and gently stir so the noodles don't stick together
                    as they sit.
                </li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine macaroni noodles, sweet pickles, red pepper, 
                    celery, red onion, and eggs. Stir until well-combined. Set aside and 
                    prepare your dressing.
                </li>
                <li>To prepare your macaroni salad dressing, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, 
                    red wine vinegar, sweet pickle juice, sugar, dijon mustard, salt, pepper, 
                    garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a medium-sized bowl. 
                    Whisk until ingredients are well-combined.
                </li>
                <li>Pour dressing over your macaroni salad ingredients and toss until well-combined.</li>
                <li>For best flavor, cover bowl and allow macaroni salad to chill for at least 
                    one hour. Stir once more before serving and enjoy!
